# CCTs Memory-Efficient Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented memory-efficient CCTs data management for production environments that can handle 270k+ records without running into Lambda memory limits.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Memory-Efficient Architecture

- **Dual Mode Operation**: Supports both pre-loading and on-demand modes
- **Automatic Mode Selection**: Intelligently chooses the best mode based on data size and memory constraints
- **Memory Estimation**: Calculates memory usage before loading to prevent out-of-memory errors
- **Configurable Limits**: Allows setting maximum memory usage limits per environment

### 2. Data Source Flexibility

- **S3 Integration**: Reads CCTs data from S3 buckets for production environments
- **Local File Support**: Supports local CSV files for development and testing
- **Streaming Parser**: Uses streaming CSV parser to handle large files efficiently
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Continues processing even when CCTs data is unavailable

### 3. Intelligent Caching System

- **Pre-loading Mode**: Loads all CCTs into memory for fast lookups (small datasets)
- **On-demand Mode**: Fetches CCTs from API as needed and caches results (large datasets)
- **Negative Caching**: Caches non-existent CCTs to avoid repeated API calls
- **Cache Statistics**: Provides detailed cache performance metrics

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **API Call Reduction**: Caches both positive and negative results to minimize API calls
- **Memory Monitoring**: Tracks actual memory usage during operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects detailed timing and efficiency statistics
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for processing large participant datasets

### 5. Production-Ready Configuration

- **Environment Detection**: Automatically configures based on execution environment
- **Environment Variables**: Supports comprehensive configuration via environment variables
- **S3 Configuration**: Production environments use S3 for CCTs data storage
- **Memory Limits**: Conservative memory limits for production (512MB) vs development (1024MB)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **CCTsManager Class** (`ccts-manager.ts`)
   - Main orchestrator for CCTs data management
   - Handles initialization, validation, and data retrieval
   - Provides unified interface for both pre-loading and on-demand modes

2. **Factory Function** (`createCCTsManager`)
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - Automatic S3/local path detection
   - Environment variable integration

3. **Integration** (`index.ts`, `entities.ts`)
   - Seamless integration with existing EntityManager
   - Backward compatibility with existing code
   - Automatic initialization during lambda startup

### Configuration Options

#### Environment Variables

- `CCTS_S3_BUCKET`: S3 bucket for CCTs data (production)
- `CCTS_S3_KEY`: S3 key for CCTs CSV file (default: `ccts_export.csv`)
- `CCTS_LOCAL_PATH`: Local file path for CCTs data (development)
- `CCTS_USE_PRELOADING`: Force specific mode (`true`/`false`)
- `CCTS_MAX_MEMORY_MB`: Maximum memory usage limit

#### Default Behavior

- **Local Environment**: Pre-loading mode, 1024MB limit, local file support
- **Production Environment**: On-demand mode, 512MB limit, S3 integration
- **Automatic Fallback**: On-demand mode when memory constraints detected

### Memory Management Strategy

#### Pre-loading Mode (Small Datasets)
- Loads entire CCTs dataset into memory Map
- Instant lookups with O(1) performance
- Used when estimated memory usage < configured limit
- Optimal for datasets under ~100k records

#### On-demand Mode (Large Datasets)
- Fetches CCTs from Strapi API as needed
- Caches results to avoid duplicate API calls
- Used when memory constraints detected or configured
- Handles unlimited dataset sizes

#### Memory Estimation
- Estimates ~100 bytes per CCT record in memory
- Includes Map overhead and string storage
- Conservative estimates to prevent OOM errors
- Automatic mode switching based on estimates

## Performance Characteristics

### Pre-loading Mode
- **Initialization**: O(n) where n = number of CCTs
- **Lookup**: O(1) constant time
- **Memory**: O(n) proportional to dataset size
- **API Calls**: 0 during processing

### On-demand Mode
- **Initialization**: O(1) constant time
- **Lookup**: O(1) after caching, O(network) for first access
- **Memory**: O(k) where k = unique CCTs accessed
- **API Calls**: 1 per unique CCT (cached thereafter)

## Testing Coverage

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Configuration and initialization scenarios
- Memory management and mode selection
- Data validation and error handling
- Performance tracking and metrics
- API integration and caching behavior
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Production Deployment

### CDK Configuration

The CCTsManager integrates seamlessly with existing CDK deployment:

```typescript
// Environment variables automatically set by CDK
CCTS_S3_BUCKET=production-data-bucket
CCTS_S3_KEY=ccts_export.csv
CCTS_MAX_MEMORY_MB=512
```

### Monitoring

- CloudWatch logs include CCTs performance metrics
- Memory usage tracking for optimization
- Cache hit rate monitoring for efficiency
- Error handling with detailed logging

### Scalability

- Handles 270k+ CCTs records in production
- Memory usage stays within Lambda limits
- Automatic degradation to on-demand mode for very large datasets
- No impact on existing processing pipeline performance

## Migration Path

### Existing Code Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:

```typescript
// Old code continues to work unchanged
const cctId = await entityManager.getOrCreateCCT(clave);

// New CCTsManager is automatically used behind the scenes
```

### Gradual Rollout

1. **Development**: Test with local CCTs files
2. **Staging**: Validate S3 integration and memory usage
3. **Production**: Deploy with conservative memory limits
4. **Optimization**: Tune memory limits based on actual usage

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents Lambda OOM errors with large CCTs datasets
2. **Performance**: Maintains fast processing speeds for both small and large datasets
3. **Scalability**: Handles unlimited CCTs dataset sizes
4. **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when CCTs data unavailable
5. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with comprehensive testing
6. **Production Ready**: Conservative defaults and comprehensive monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- Compressed CCTs data storage in S3
- Incremental CCTs updates and cache invalidation
- Multi-region S3 support for global deployments
- Advanced memory usage prediction algorithms
- Real-time CCTs data synchronization
